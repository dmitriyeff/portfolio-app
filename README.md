# Personal Portfolio Site

Portfolio Site is a responsive website that displays images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects I have completed throughout the course of Udacity Nanodegree program.
Website was built with Angular using Bootstrap.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dmitriyeff/portfolio-project
